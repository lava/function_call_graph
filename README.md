This repository contains a script `perf2dtrace.rb` that can convert stack
samples generated by `perf script` into the function trace format generated
by dtrace.

It also contains a slightly modified version of Neelakanth Nagdir's
`function_call_graph.rb` that can take these function traces and generate
an interactive time-ordered call graph in svg format from them.

The original version of that script, as published on the Sun blogs,
can be found in the initial commit of this repository.
